                External and InternalIn AT&T Labs' Big Data Research organization, we develop new methods for analyzing massive data sets to learn about our network and our customers, and to improve services and operations. We are a pioneer in big data technologies – developing  novel methodologies for statistical computing, event prediction, fraud detection, visualization, text mining, data stream management, data quality and anomaly detection, and privacy preserving measures such as data anonymization.We are looking for strong analysts in a data science field with a passion for extracting insights from large data sets.  We work on problems that cut across all aspects of AT&T's business, including network and service management, marketing and customer care, network design and optimization, and new service creation.  Many analysts work directly with business unit leaders.   All have opportunities to invent novel, publishable methodology that address real-world problems.   Increasingly we contribute to multiple data science disciplines through open source projects, led by AT&T.  We typically hire to fill two positions:Our PhD level Inventive Scientists are technical leaders in their field, establishing external recognition while creating innovative, business-impacting solutions.  Data Scientists will usually have a Master’s; they are responsible for the entire data – to – solution pipeline.  They both support the Inventive Scientists and are responsible for their own projects.Location can be Bedminster, NJ or New York, NY. Desired areas of expertise:- Spatiotemporal analysis of mobile data - The AT&T network generates billions of records per day from handheld devices, each one providing a data point in time and space.  Understanding the dynamics of this data through time series and spatial statistics helps AT&T better serve its customers, improve its network, and develop new products and services.- Statistical computation - AT&T is developing high-performance statistical models and algorithms (mostly in R) to leverage modern streaming and storage technologies. One example is the AT&T collaborative coding project RCloud   http://rcloud.social/ .- Text mining - AT&T is modeling free-form text from millions of customer surveys,  representative notes, and chats as one way to manage our business in real time. New methods are needed to keep up with the volume and complexity of this data.- Data visualization - AT&T creates algorithms, systems, and techniques for visualizing new data sets at increasingly large scale. AT&T is especially interested in interactive visualization of very large geospatial and temporal data. One example is our open source project Nanocubes   http://nanocubes.net  .- Database management and data quality - AT&T is building high-performance and low latency systems to manage high velocity data streams. These systems are critical for accurate processing and analysis of data from the AT&T mobile network. Analyzing the data to identify glitches, and cleaning the data to minimize distortion while preserving maximal underlying variation, are essential to ensure meaningful big data analytics.- Predictive Modeling – We estimate models to predict customer behavior and sentiment, service disruptions, and event impacts.  Models serve to both target, and to gain insight into variable relationships.  Our rich customer and network data allows analysts to positively affect business outcomes and to pursue methodological research (comparing machine learning algorithms, for example).  Please visit http://www.research.att.com to learn more about AT&T Research.  Qualifications- Inventive Scientist candidates shall have a PhD or equivalent in a data science field, including these most commonly:  Statistics, Computer Science, Machine Learning, Operations Research, Computer Engineering, and Mathematics. - Data Science candidates shall have a Master’s or PhD in a data science field. - Experience and passion for finding solutions to real world, applied problems.

"Data Scientist - Live Games","King","Stockholm, ME",NA,"TRUE","TRUE","FALSE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","FALSE","About the Job
        
                We are looking for a talented and creative Data Scientist interested in building, defining and pushing the boundaries of games analytics within our Stockholm studio, focusing on our live games – Candy Crush and Candy Crush Soda Saga. You'll have a proven ability to apply your skills, be it technical, behavioural or economic, in order to generate value for the studio's new generation of awesome mobile games.
Your role within our Kingdom
If you want to improve the experience of King's 300 million+ players across our network of games, then this may be the right opportunity for you. You'll help us to further understand, model, predict, segment and retain our players. You will be part of a community of 80+ business intelligence & analytics experts, while working on a daily basis in smaller teams of 6-8 people. As a data scientist at King, your role will be focused on particular games, our network or specific business areas.
Specifically, you'll:
* Identify potential business opportunities and scope/design approaches to capture those opportunities
* Translate business needs to technical requirements and AB-tests, then work with development teams to ensure correct implementation and tracking
* Develop an analysis strategy and perform analysis of complex scenarios and AB-tests, both systematically and on a one-off basis.
* Carefully check, debug, and problem solve issues to ensure you deliver accurate and clear analysis and reports, even when confronted by subtle data complications
* Provide an analytics perspective to discussions and helping to drive the priorities within your team
* Be the pro-active owner of the entire data chain for your game(s)
Skills to create thrills
You have a passion for quantitative analysis, understanding player behaviour and will have the ability to draw business insights which will add real value to King. You will need to demonstrate the ability to learn quickly and will have worked in a fast paced and collaborative environment. This role will involve working with teams and individuals across King - such as Game Developers, Business Performance Managers and Marketeers, so excellent communication skills are essential.
While we certainly don't expect you to have all of these skills from day one, we do expect you to learn and develop in each of the following five areas:
* Business Insight: The ability to understand the problems and issues our games and business wants to solve, and then defining the right data, analysis or interpretation to lead to the right recommendations and decisions
* Player behavior: Understanding the players' motivation is key to design valuable tests and interpret results
* SQL: The ability to write complex SQL queries to analyse our databases with 300+ million players, and work effectively with both Hive and relational database systems
* Analytical coding: Using tools such as R, Python (and also Excel) for analytical purposes
* Stats: Understanding the appropriate statistical techniques to use in different circumstances
* Communication: Designing good ways of communicating, visualising or reporting your results/analysis so they are clear and unambiguous
There is plenty of scope at King for you to learn from your colleagues in the areas where you have less experience, and to share your own skills where you are stronger.
Specific experience that might be helpful, but is not required, includes: experience in the games industry or similarly sophisticated customer-facing digital businesses; experience in ""big data"" systems such as Hadoop, Hive; experience in behavioural psychology/economics; robust understanding of more advanced statistical techniques suitable for analysis of highly skewed populations; experience in predictive analytics, segmentation, and related areas; experience in experimental design; software engineering skills in Java and other languages (beyond R and Python which we use most frequently); skills with standard reporting tools such as QlikView/Tableau/etc.
Personal Attributes
* Smart – intellectual dexterity
* High integrity
* Low ego
* Pragmatic problem-solver - someone who looks for solutions rather than worrying about problems
We're knights of creativity!
We believe that great gaming experiences happen when they are developed by working in small, autonomous creative teams that control the whole process – from idea to amazing game. Our close connection with the player community gets us instant feedback and enables us to deliver truly magical moments. We value your free time and your need to refuel, relax and find inspiration – by playing games with your colleagues, being at home with your family or going to the gym or out for a run. That's how we stay creative. That's why we call ourselves developers of magic and knights of creativity!
Want to join our Kingdom?
If you are interested, please apply! Applications must be in English.
The brilliant experience we give our players comes from the diversity and experience of our people. A great saga needs all sorts of heroes. That's why we hire all sorts of talent.

* Identify potential business opportunities and scope/design approaches to capture those opportunities
* Translate business needs to technical requirements and AB-tests, then work with development teams to ensure correct implementation and tracking
* Develop an analysis strategy and perform analysis of complex scenarios and AB-tests, both systematically and on a one-off basis.
* Carefully check, debug, and problem solve issues to ensure you deliver accurate and clear analysis and reports, even when confronted by subtle data complications
* Provide an analytics perspective to discussions and helping to drive the priorities within your team
* Be the pro-active owner of the entire data chain for your game(s)
Skills to create thrills
You have a passion for quantitative analysis, understanding player behaviour and will have the ability to draw business insights which will add real value to King. You will need to demonstrate the ability to learn quickly and will have worked in a fast paced and collaborative environment. This role will involve working with teams and individuals across King - such as Game Developers, Business Performance Managers and Marketeers, so excellent communication skills are essential.
While we certainly don't expect you to have all of these skills from day one, we do expect you to learn and develop in each of the following five areas:
* Business Insight: The ability to understand the problems and issues our games and business wants to solve, and then defining the right data, analysis or interpretation to lead to the right recommendations and decisions
* Player behavior: Understanding the players' motivation is key to design valuable tests and interpret results
* SQL: The ability to write complex SQL queries to analyse our databases with 300+ million players, and work effectively with both Hive and relational database systems
* Analytical coding: Using tools such as R, Python (and also Excel) for analytical purposes
* Stats: Understanding the appropriate statistical techniques to use in different circumstances
* Communication: Designing good ways of communicating, visualising or reporting your results/analysis so they are clear and unambiguous
There is plenty of scope at King for you to learn from your colleagues in the areas where you have less experience, and to share your own skills where you are stronger.
Specific experience that might be helpful, but is not required, includes: experience in the games industry or similarly sophisticated customer-facing digital businesses; experience in ""big data"" systems such as Hadoop, Hive; experience in behavioural psychology/economics; robust understanding of more advanced statistical techniques suitable for analysis of highly skewed populations; experience in predictive analytics, segmentation, and related areas; experience in experimental design; software engineering skills in Java and other languages (beyond R and Python which we use most frequently); skills with standard reporting tools such as QlikView/Tableau/etc.

Our close connection with the player community gets us instant feedback and enables us to deliver truly magical moments. We value your free time and your need to refuel, relax and find inspiration – by playing games with your colleagues, being at home with your family or going to the gym or out for a run.

                We are looking for a talented and creative Data Scientist interested in building, defining and pushing the boundaries of games analytics within our Berlin studio, with the opportunity to work on one of our biggest live titles - Candy Crush Jelly Saga. You'll have a proven ability to apply your skills, be it technical, behavioural or economic, in order to generate value for the studio's new generation of awesome mobile games.
Your role within our Kingdom
If you want to improve the experience of King's 300 million+ players across our network of games, then this may be the right opportunity for you. You'll help us to further understand, model, predict, segment and retain our players. You will be part of a community of 80+ business intelligence & analytics experts, while working on a daily basis in smaller teams of 6-8 people. As a data scientist at King, your role will be focused on particular games, our network or specific business areas.
Specifically, you'll:
* Identify potential business opportunities and scope/design approaches to capture those opportunities
* Translate business needs to technical requirements and AB-tests, then work with development teams to ensure correct implementation and tracking
* Develop an analysis strategy and perform analysis of complex scenarios and AB-tests, both systematically and on a one-off basis.
* Carefully check, debug, and problem solve issues to ensure you deliver accurate and clear analysis and reports, even when confronted by subtle data complications
* Provide an analytics perspective to discussions and helping to drive the priorities within your team
* Be the pro-active owner of the entire data chain for your game(s)
Skills to create thrills
You have a passion for quantitative analysis, understanding player behaviour and will have the ability to draw business insights which will add real value to King. You will need to demonstrate the ability to learn quickly and will have worked in a fast paced and collaborative environment. This role will involve working with teams and individuals across King - such as Game Developers, Business Performance Managers and Marketeers, so excellent communication skills are essential.
While we certainly don't expect you to have all of these skills from day one, we do expect you to learn and develop in each of the following five areas:
* Business Insight: The ability to understand the problems and issues our games and business wants to solve, and then defining the right data, analysis or interpretation to lead to the right recommendations and decisions
* Player behavior: Understanding the players' motivation is key to design valuable tests and interpret results
* SQL: The ability to write complex SQL queries to analyse our databases with 300+ million players, and work effectively with both Hive and relational database systems
* Analytical coding: Using tools such as R, Python (and also Excel) for analytical purposes
* Stats: Understanding the appropriate statistical techniques to use in different circumstances
* Communication: Designing good ways of communicating, visualising or reporting your results/analysis so they are clear and unambiguous
There is plenty of scope at King for you to learn from your colleagues in the areas where you have less experience, and to share your own skills where you are stronger.
Specific experience that might be helpful, but is not required, includes: experience in the games industry or similarly sophisticated customer-facing digital businesses; experience in ""big data"" systems such as Hadoop, Hive; experience in behavioural psychology/economics; robust understanding of more advanced statistical techniques suitable for analysis of highly skewed populations; experience in predictive analytics, segmentation, and related areas; experience in experimental design; software engineering skills in Java and other languages (beyond R and Python which we use most frequently); skills with standard reporting tools such as QlikView/Tableau/etc.
Personal Attributes
* Smart – intellectual dexterity
* High integrity
* Low ego
* Pragmatic problem-solver - someone who looks for solutions rather than worrying about problems
We're knights of creativity!
We believe that great gaming experiences happen when they are developed by working in small, autonomous creative teams that control the whole process – from idea to amazing game. Our close connection with the player community gets us instant feedback and enables us to deliver truly magical moments. We value your free time and your need to refuel, relax and find inspiration – by playing games with your colleagues, being at home with your family or going to the gym or out for a run. That's how we stay creative. That's why we call ourselves developers of magic and knights of creativity!
Want to join our Kingdom?
If you are interested, please apply! Applications must be in English.
The brilliant experience we give our players comes from the diversity and experience of our people. A great saga needs all sorts of heroes. That's why we hire all sorts of talent.
